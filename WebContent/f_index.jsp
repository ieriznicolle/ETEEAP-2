		<h3>Expanded Tertiary Education Equivalency and Accreditation Program (ETEEAP)</h3><br>
		The ETEEAP of the Commission on Higher Education (CHED) is an educational assessment scheme which recognizes knowledge, 
		skill and prior learning attained by individuals from non-formal and informal educational experiences.
		<br><br>
		Using equivalency competence standard and a comprehensive assessment system which employ written tests and combined assessment 
		methodologies, a higher education institution may administer competency-based evaluation as basis of accrediting learning experiences.
		<br><br>
		A panel of assessors is convened to determine the candidate's knowledge, skills and attitudes relevant to a particular discipline 
		and consequently equivalent credits and appropriate certificates and degrees are awarded by administering higher education institutions.
